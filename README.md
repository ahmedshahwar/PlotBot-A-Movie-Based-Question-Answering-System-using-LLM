# PlotBot: Movie-based Question-Answering System

PlotBot is a Question-Answering System designed to answer questions related to movies. It utilizes LLM (Langchain, OpenAI, VertexAI, Llama v2) for generating responses based on given queries.

## Project Description

This repository contains the codebase for PlotBot, developed as a semester project for the Natural Language Processing course at Bahria University, Islamabad.

## Demo Video

Check out the demo video of PlotBot in action [here](https://youtu.be/1kA1UIpNx30).

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be downloaded from the [CMU's website](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/data/MovieSummaries.tar.gz). This dataset provides movie summaries along with other metadata which serve as the basis for generating responses in PlotBot.
The detailed version of the metadata with an example can be seen [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/).
